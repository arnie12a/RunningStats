Running a forest preserve is also such a good vibe and I want to most definitely include these types of runs in the future. Also, me and Kaycie have officially broken things off so running is going to be a really good outlet for moving on in the near future. The long run felt really good I just need to do a better job of when I am tired to jog slowly and not walk because that would really improve my overall time.
